About Airbnb Optimal Price:
Our PVD:
What problem does your app solve?

The app takes the guesswork out of the pricing for your property rental on AirBnB, and delivers the optimal price point for the location,time of year, and other variables (potentially many, depending on the data we can find) in order to make the most money.


Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

The app will utilize historical AirBnB data to build machine learning models that will accurately deliver price info with a user-friendly, simple interface. Adjustments can be made to prioritize booking utilization (% of time booked?) and or pricing. 


What is the mission statement?

Making you the most money. 
Optimizing the use of your home by showing you the most likely price at which you will be able to provide a fair offering and excellent experience to your guests

ðŸ§® For Data Scientists
Describe the established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day one.

Steven: Looks like this is our training file:
https://www.kaggle.com/stevezhenghp/airbnb-price-prediction

Write a description for what the data science problem is. What uncertainty or prediction are you trying to discover? How could this data be used to find a solution to this problem?

Target is a regression problem, given as log_price
Treatment are various different house features
Main features to be shown: city, neighbourhood, #bedroom, #beds, #bathroom, amenities, #guest allowed, room type


What kind of target output can you deliver to the Web/UX/iOS teams to work with? Is it in JSON format or something else?

Probably JSON or floating point


ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience
Airbnb users
Property owners, or prospective property owners who hope to rent.


What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

Have you validated this problem and your solution with a target audience? Describe how




ðŸ”‘ Prototype Key Feature(s)
How long do you think it will take to implement these features?

	3.5 days.7777777


Do you anticipate working on stretch functionality after completion of a Minimal Viable Product?

	Yes -- maybe international data? Merge other data sources? Too far away to tell.


For backend, the load should be minimal enough to work on additional features to save optimal prices for each property once the machine learning model has already solved that specific property set. This would avoid having the machine learning model being required to calculate the same parameters more than once.
